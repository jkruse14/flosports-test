Create a single page application using Angular 4 and hosted on Firebase hosting. It should have two screens with tabbed navigation.

The first tab should be for data input and have the following:

Team 1 (text box)
Team 2 (text box)
Team 1 Score (some sort of numeric incrementing field) 
Team 2 Score (some sort of numeric incrementing field) 
Team 1 Color (some sort of color selection)
Team 2 Color (some sort of color selection)
Clock where you can set the starting time and a button to start the countdown, stopping at zero

The second tab should display the result of each teamâ€™s name and score. The score should have 
the background color that was selected on the first tab for that screen. The clock should also 
display in minutes:seconds format and count down in one second intervals.

The first tab should not update the second tab directly, instead it should update Firebase, and 
the second tab should subscribe to that Firebase endpoint and display the values.
