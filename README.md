In the **Edit Scores** tab, FloScoreBoard allows you to create matchups between two teams, assigning a name and color to each. Once you start the match clock, you can increment each team's score while the clock is running (the clock can be paused). Once the clock hits zero, the match is final and scores may no longer be updated.

The **Scoreboard** Tab displays all matchups in a non-editable board.
